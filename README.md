# Biomechanics-joint-angle-analysis
This toolbox is intended as educational content to use joint angles to compute joint angles from optical markers. Further, the toolbox explores several ways to compare joint angle data from c3d optical data and IMU angles, including statistical parametric mapping (SPM), root mean squared error (RMSE) and offset.
