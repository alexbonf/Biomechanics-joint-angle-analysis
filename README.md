# Biomechanics-joint-angle-analysis
This toolbox is intended as educational content on Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). We explore the theory behind their working principles and methods to compute anatomical joint angles. Further, the toolbox provides a practical example to compute upper limb joint angles through N-pose calibration and explores several ways to validate this data against data from c3d optical motion capture. For comparison purposes, we compute the range of motion (ROM) error, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and offset between the two systems.
